# JSONiq Cookbook [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/28msec/jsoniq-cookbook.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/28msec/jsoniq-cookbook)

JSONiq is a query and processing language specifically designed for the popular JSON data
model. The main ideas behind JSONiq are based on lessons learned in more than 30 years of
relational query systems and more than 15 years of experience with designing and implementing
query languages for semi-structured data. As a result, JSONiq is an expressive and highly
optimizable language to query and update any kind of JSONiq store or resource. It enables
developers to leverage the same productive high-level language across a variety of NoSQL
products.

This cookbook gives some useful recipes when using JSONiq for querying data. Another useful resource is the [JSONiq ebook](http://www.28.io/jsoniq-the-sql-of-nosql).
